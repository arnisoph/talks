### Title
Kubernetes for Developers - From Code to Production

### Abstract
Kubernetes deployment tools like kops have grown up and enable you to run fully automated infrastructure and application workload on powerful platforms such as AWS (IaaS/SaaS). Setting up Kubernetes Clusters has never been easier before! We finally arrived in the cloud, what a time to be alive!
But to be honest, having vanilla Kubernetes clusters is absolutely useless for your users! Think of load balancers, VPN, on premise datacenter connectivity, databases, monitoring, continuous integration/delivery, software repositories (JAR/WAR/Docker images/Git), secrets management, RBAC/SSO, … and so on.
One of our customers asked us to support their move into the cloud. We delivered. Starting from an old-fashioned web-based application platform we’ve introduced Kubernetes and a completely new set of Open Source tools in AWS regions around the globe.
This talk will showcase the self-service platform from a developer’s perspective like workflows and tooling.
